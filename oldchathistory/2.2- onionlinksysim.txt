Complete Implementation of Onion Link Discovery System
I've successfully implemented all the components for your enhanced dark web research system with comprehensive onion link discovery capabilities. Here's what has been completed:

Core Components Implemented
OnionLinkDatabase (onion_database.py)
SQLite database for storing and managing onion links
Full CRUD operations for links with metadata
Statistics, search, and export/import capabilities
Seed Data Module (seed_data.py)
Initial set of directory sites and search engines
Verification system for checking seed link accessibility
Categorized seed data to jumpstart discovery
Enhanced Crawler (enhanced_crawler.py)
Advanced crawler with database integration
Discovery from directories and search engines
Batch crawling and link categorization
Updated Configuration (config.py)
New parameters for discovery modes and database paths
Directory structure management
Customizable crawling parameters
Enhanced Agent (agent.py)
Updated to use the enhanced crawler and database
Improved discovery and search capabilities
Better reporting with discovery statistics
Complete UI Integration (app.py)
Tabbed interface with Research, Explorer, and Visualization
Database management and statistics
Network visualization of discovered links
Progress tracking and result management
How to Use the System
Start the Streamlit App
CopyInsert
streamlit run app.py
Configure Discovery Settings
Choose a discovery mode (passive/active/aggressive)
Set crawl depth and batch size
Verify Tor connection
Run Research Queries
Enter your research query
View results with network visualization
Explore discovered onion links
Manage the Database
Export/backup the database
Verify seed links
Browse by category or status
The system will automatically initialize and maintain the database, creating necessary directories and seeding initial data. It provides comprehensive visibility into the dark web through an integrated discovery process that builds upon each research query.

Would you like me to explain any specific component in more detail or make any additional enhancements to the system?

Remaining Implementation and Fixes
After reviewing the entire system, here are the key areas that still need to be implemented or fixed:

1. Error Handling & Robustness
Tor Connection Fallback: Implement fallback to clearnet (using Tavily API) when Tor is unavailable
Circuit Rotation: Add automatic Tor circuit rotation for long crawl sessions
Exception Recovery: Improve recovery from network failures during crawling
Database Integrity: Add transaction management for database operations
2. Security & Privacy Features
Content Filtering: Implement NSFW content filtering using Gemini AI
Request Throttling: Add more sophisticated throttling based on site response times
Header Randomization: Implement more variation in HTTP headers to avoid fingerprinting
Connection Management: Add cookie handling and session persistence options
3. Advanced Analytics
Content Classification: Extend the categorization to more detailed taxonomies
Entity Extraction: Extract entities (people, organizations, products) from crawled content
Sentiment Analysis: Add sentiment analysis for forum content
Trend Detection: Implement trend detection across time-series data
4. Performance Optimizations
Parallel Crawling: Implement concurrent crawling with proper rate limiting
Database Indexing: Optimize database indices for faster queries
Caching Layer: Add caching for frequently accessed data
Memory Management: Improve memory usage during large crawl operations
5. Testing & Validation
Unit Tests: Create test suite for database and crawler components
Integration Tests: Implement end-to-end testing of the discovery process
Mock Tor Services: Create mock services for testing without actual Tor network
6. UI Enhancements
Real-time Updates: Add WebSocket for real-time crawl progress updates
Advanced Visualization: Implement more sophisticated network visualizations
Search Filtering: Add advanced search filters in the UI
Export Formats: Support more export formats (CSV, Excel, GraphML)
7. Documentation
User Manual: Create comprehensive user documentation
API Documentation: Document the internal APIs for extension
Configuration Guide: Detail all configuration options
Immediate Next Steps
If you want to prioritize the most impactful next steps, I would recommend:

Error handling and recovery - This will make the system more robust
Content filtering - Important for safety
Parallel crawling - Major performance improvement
Testing framework - Essential for ongoing development
Would you like me to implement any of these specific components next?
